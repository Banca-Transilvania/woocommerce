### Building the frontend design for the payment method
 To make changes to the frontend you need to change the file `./blocks/index.js` to apply the changes you ether run `npm run build` or `npm run serve` to run in live reload mode. 

 The resulting file will be located in `./dist/blocks.js` and will loaded on the checkout page.
